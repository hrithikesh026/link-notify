# link-notify
Send notification through telegram bot when a google form is enabled

## Story behind this project

During the pandemic days attendance of online classes was made mandatory by the College.


In order to record the attendance, lecturers would enable the google form for 2-3 minutes towards the end of the class and ask us to fill it within the given time. So the only way to get attendance was to sit through the online lecture.


This bot was built to notify my friends when the attendance form is enabled, So that they don't actually have to sit for the entire session just for attendance.


A student could set a reminder for a subject and sit back and do his own thing. The bot will notify the student at the exact time when the form link is enabled so that he can mark his attendance.
